The information will be used to fill in a placeholder recipient that is in the template. We then call the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/Templates/Templates/list'>Templates:list</a> method on the account to check if a template exists. If it does, we find the templateId; if not, we call the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/Templates/Templates/create'>Templates:create</a> method to create a new template with the required fields, documents, and a single placeholder recipient.</p><h5>Step 2</h5><p>We proceed to create an envelope from the template by using the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/Envelopes/Envelopes/create'>Envelopes:create</a> method, using the provided email address and name for the recipient. The envelope is created and immediately sent out for remote signing by the single recipient. The recipient receives an email that includes instructions for how to proceed with the IDV process and eventually sign the document.</p>"
